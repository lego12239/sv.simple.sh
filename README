sv.simple.sh is a very simple supervisor written in bash.

DESCRIPTION
===========

sv.simple.sh is a simple supervisor that might be used as a supervisor
framework.

By default, it can only do start and stop.

Before a first use, "sleep 1m" in the while body should be replaced with
needed command.

PIDFILE variable should be defined in environment before every sv.simple.sh
call, because start and stop actions depend on its value.
